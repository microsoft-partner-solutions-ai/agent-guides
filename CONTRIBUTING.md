# Contributing to Agent Guides

Thank you for your interest in contributing agent guides for Microsoft partners! This document provides guidelines for creating and submitting new agent guides.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a new agent guide, ensure you have:
- A working Copilot Studio Lite agent that has been tested and validated
- Clear documentation of the agent's purpose and use cases
- All necessary knowledge sources properly documented
- A set of suggested prompts that demonstrate the agent's capabilities

## Agent Guide Structure

Each agent guide must follow this standardized structure below. For easy creation, copy and rename the `agent-guide-template/` folder

### Folder Naming
- Use lowercase letters with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Be descriptive and specific (e.g., `ai-discovery-cards-agent`)
- Avoid generic names

### Required Files

#### 1. README.md
The README should include:
- **Agent Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Description**: What problem does this agent solve?
- **Target Use Cases**: Specific scenarios where this agent excels

#### 2. system-instructions.md
This file contains the complete system prompt for the agent:
- Write clear, comprehensive instructions
- Define the agent's role, capabilities, and limitations
- Include any specific behavioral guidelines
- Specify output format requirements if applicable
- Use markdown formatting, and capture prompt in text block to preserve markdown for copy/paste

#### 3a. knowledge-sources.md
Document all knowledge sources used by the agent:
- **Type**: Files, URLs, Outlook, Teams, etc.
- **Description**: What each source provides

#### 3b. uploaded-files/ folder (optional as needed)
Folder containing all files needed for upload (.txt, .docx, .pptx, .pdf, etc)

#### 4. suggested-prompts.md
Provide 3 or more example prompts that demonstrate the agent's capabilities:
- Cover different use cases
- Range from simple to complex queries
- Show the variety of tasks the agent can handle

## Submission Process
